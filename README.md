# Customer Churn Analysis in Banking  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Customer churn is a critical issue in the banking sector. This project aims to analyze customer churn patterns and predict potential churners using data analysis and machine learning techniques.  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset contains customer details such as demographics, account activity, transaction history, and churn status. Key features include:  
- **Customer ID**  
- **Age, Gender, and Location**  
- **Account Balance and CibilScore**  
- **Services Used (Credit Cards, etc.)**  
- **Churn Status (0 - Retained, 1 - Churned)**  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)  
- Scikit-Learn, XGBoost (Machine Learning)  

## 📌 Steps Involved  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Feature scaling  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Churn rate distribution  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Customer segmentation  

3. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Trees & Random Forest  
   - XGBoost for improved performance  

4. **Evaluation & Insights**  
   - Model performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)  
   - Business recommendations for churn reduction  

## 📈 Results  
- Identified key factors influencing customer churn.  
- Developed a machine learning model with optimized performance.  
- Provided actionable insights for customer retention strategies.
